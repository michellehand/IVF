# 🧬 IVF Coverage & Cost Impact Analysis — CA SB 729 (2024)

This project was developed in response to **California Senate Bill 729 (SB 729)**, which mandates that **self-funded employers in California provide in vitro fertilization (IVF) benefits** starting in 2024.

The goal was to assess the **financial impact of IVF coverage** using claims data, estimate the **average cost of IVF treatment**, and analyze the **rate of member utilization** through employer-sponsored health plans.

- **Policy Context**: CA SB 729 requires IVF benefit parity with other medical plan components.
- **Collaboration**: Partnered with the **Actuarial Team** to:
  - Identify IVF-related claims in the 2024 dataset
  - Estimate per-member IVF costs
  - Determine member utilization rates under employer coverage
- **Tools Used**: `SQL`, `Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)`, `Excel`, actuarial cost models

## 💸 Cost & Financial Impact Summary

### 📊 IVF Cost Benchmarks (2024, National Averages)
- **$15,000 – $25,000** per IVF treatment cycle
- Cost varies significantly by **geography**, **provider contracts**, and **plan design**

### 🧾 Estimated Employer Impact
- **1% – 2% increase** in overall medical plan cost projections
- Factors influencing cost:
  - Member demographics
  - Plan design features (lifetime limits, cycle caps, prior auth)
  - Regional pricing variation

### ⚖️ Compliance Note
- SB 729 mandates **cost-sharing parity**: IVF benefits must match other plan features (e.g., deductible, copay)
- Employers are encouraged to **consult legal counsel** to ensure compliance
