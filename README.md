# IVF
This project was in response to CA SB 729 that requires self-funded employers in California to provide IVF benefits. Collaborated with the Actuary Team in order to determine what is the currect cost of IVF treatment in 2024 in the database and the rate of members having IVF treatment through their employer. Company data has been replaced with mock data to view publicly.

II. Cost and financial impact

Actuarial analysis: MMAâ€™s data shows that the annual IVF cost in 2024 is $15,000 to $25,000 nationally, but the price will vary depending on group geography, demographics, and other factors.
Cost control strategies: It seems that the benefit plan design for the IVF benefits must align with the other features of the plan. We recommend consulting with your legal counsel on this matter.
Premium impact vs. cash flow: The anticipated cost impact to health plans is 1% to 2% of the medical plan budget, but this could vary depending on the geographical location, demographics, and the stakeholders' plan design features. The CA SB 729 bill says that the cost-sharing for IVF benefits must be similar to the other attributes of the plan to ensure parity.
