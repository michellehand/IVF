🧬 IVF Coverage & Cost Impact Analysis — CA SB 729 (2024)
This project was conducted in response to California Senate Bill 729 (SB 729), which mandates that self-funded employers in California must provide IVF (in vitro fertilization) benefits beginning in 2024.

The objective was to analyze the financial impact of IVF coverage using medical claims data and to estimate both the current cost of IVF treatment and the rate of utilization among eligible members.

🔒 Note: All company-specific data has been replaced with mock data to preserve confidentiality. Logic, structure, and methodology remain reflective of the original study.

💼 Project Overview
Policy Context: CA SB 729 requires IVF coverage for self-funded employer health plans.

Collaboration: Partnered with the Actuarial Team to:

Identify IVF-related claims in the 2024 dataset

Quantify average IVF treatment costs

Estimate prevalence of IVF treatment in the employer population

Tools Used: SQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Excel, Actuarial models

💸 Cost & Financial Impact Summary
📊 National IVF Cost (Actuarial Benchmarks)
Estimated average IVF cost per treatment cycle in 2024:
$15,000 to $25,000, depending on geography, provider, and treatment plan

Geographic variation and member demographics affect pricing significantly

🧾 Health Plan Impact
Expected financial impact to employer medical plans:

1% to 2% of total medical spend

May vary based on region, plan design, and member utilization patterns

⚖️ Plan Design Considerations
IVF coverage must align with other core plan features per SB 729 (e.g., cost-sharing parity)

Employers should consult legal counsel to ensure benefit compliance with SB 729

📌 Key Takeaways
IVF treatment remains a high-cost, low-prevalence benefit, but critical for equity and parity

Legislative compliance (SB 729) requires thoughtful plan design and cost forecasting

This analysis supports financial modeling, compliance planning, and employer decision-making
